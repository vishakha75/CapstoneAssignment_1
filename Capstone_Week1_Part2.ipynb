    "Although FourSquare provides a comprehensive API, one of the things that API does not easily support is a mechanism to directly extract the top N sites / venues in a given city. This data, however, is easily available directly from the FourSquare Website. To do this simply go to www.foursquare.com, enter the city of your choise and select Top Picks from I'm Looking For selection field.\n",
