1 Introduction
DÃ¼sseldorf is a german city with the highest concentration of japanese citizens outside Japan. Apart from a big number of subsidiaries of big Japanese companies and banks, there is also a plethora of japanese shops and restaurants. Our client a recent arrival from Japan wishes to open another restaurant in the city. Since he is unfamiliar with the place, he needs advice on where to open and what kind of food to offer. We, therefore, try to identify areas in which japanese restaurants tend to thrive and then pick one where the competition is particularly weak. Lastly we will choose a category of japanese food (e.g. Ramen, Sushi, general) that is generally popular but again faces weak competition in our selected area. In the end the client will be left with a very specific recommendation.

2 Data
The area data can be accessed under https://www.dasoertliche.de/Themen/Postleitzahlen/D%C3%BCsseldorf.html. It is from the german phone register provided by the Deutsche Telekom AG and is free to use. Unlike in the previous exercises we will divide the city by postal codes and not by neighborhoods, since that is how the data is structured. We will use the geocoder package to add coordinates and the FourSquare API explore call to retrieve data about the composition of the areas. This will give us a list of venues listed on FourSquare. Apart from business this can for example be tourist sites or sites for access to public transport. Lastly the data about the competing venues in the chosen area is retrieved from the FourSqare API to see how those businesses are rated by customers.
